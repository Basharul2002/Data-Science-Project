# Data Science Projects

Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains various data science projects that explore different techniques and methodologies in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project aims to predict loan eligibility based on various features such as applicant's income, loan amount, credit history, etc. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using classification algorithms like Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.

#### Key Features
- **Dataset**: Utilizes `loan_train_data.csv` and `loan_test_data.csv`
- **Algorithms**: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 70.73% accuracy with the Decision Tree model

#### Libraries Used
- **pandas**: for data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: for numerical computations
- **matplotlib**: for data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: for machine learning models and metrics

#### How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `Loan Eligibility Prediction.ipynb`
